# Weather Forecast App
This repo contains a simple weather application that uses NWS (National Weather Service) data to display the standard 5-day forecast in under 100-lines of code.

## To Run this app:
After cloning the repo install all the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then launch the application locally. This is a streamlit app so once you've installed the dependencies just run this command
```
streamlit run main_app.py
```
This should open your browser automatically and you should see a page that looks like this
